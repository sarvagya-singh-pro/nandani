Hi everyone

This is nandani [previously cattleit] Nandani is a platform that aims to provide milkmen across the city access to professional medical advice from veterinarians. It offers video call features to connect milkmen directly with vets across the city. Additionally, Nandani utilizes AI to help detect common diseases in cattle such as anthrax, blackleg, foot and mouth disease, lumpy virus, and pneumonia.
